  <h1>about blog.embeepea.me</h1>
  <p>
    This is my blog.  This is where I write stuff that I want to record so that
    I'll have a place to look it up later, or ideas that I'm looking to get feedback on.
  </p>
  <p>
    I use the name <em>embeepea</em> online.  It's longhand for my initials, which are "mbp".
    (The name "mbp" was already taken.)
